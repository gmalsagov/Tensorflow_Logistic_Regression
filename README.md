# Tensorflow Multi-Class Logistic Regression

This Tf model implements a one-hot-encoding of words called bag-of-words together with Logistic Regression to classify emotion state of the user from short text messages. The dataset used in this model represents a collection of tweets with hashtags corresponding to emotion types (anger, sadness, joy, disgust, guilt, shame, fear). This model scored above 77% on accuracy test when trained and tested on 'iseardataset.csv' dataset with 80%-20% train-test ratio.
